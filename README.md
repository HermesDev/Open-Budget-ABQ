## Development & Branching 

Do not attempt to use the *master* branch - it only contains early experimental code. All development is happening on the [*dev*](https://github.com/codeforabq/Open-Budget-ABQ/tree/dev) branch and feature branches. Feature branches will be merged into *dev*. We will only merge into *master* when we are ready to release a stable version.

We welcome contributions from anyone at any time, either in code or in the issue queue. If you fork our project and make improvements, we encourage you to submit a pull request so we can consider incorporating your improvements.
