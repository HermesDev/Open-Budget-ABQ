# Open-Budget-ABQ
This project would translate the Abq budget info from verbose pdf into web app or obtain the data (currently pushing the city to make open budget data available).  This is a small project, but has potential for growth (eg, showing proposed budget?  letting users thumb up/down parts the budget they like or dislike)
